#Testing

TFLint is an open-source, static analysis tool for Terraform that focuses on linting. It is able to detect errors that Terraform plan cannot detect. Terraform avoids making API calls during validation. This reduces the maintenance required to update checks as underlying providers change and ensures quick validation. This strategy welcomes third-party tools such as TFLint to perform more thorough checks. Even though it may take longer to run TFLint than Terraform's validate, it can take significantly longer to wait for apply to run and find an error after many resources have been deployed and may need to be deleted. TFLint can save you from the associated expenses and hassle of deploying a partial environment due to a configuration error.

In this Lab Step, you will install and use TFLint to check the sample Terraform configuration. A Docker image is also maintained for TFLint. You will use TFLint in a container in a later Lab Step.




TFLint is for AWS resources only
There are slow rules and deep checks including checking for valid Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
TFLint follows similar patterns as Terraform including the ability to use an HCL file to configure it
If you intend to use TFLint in an automation setting, use the --error-with-issues option to return a non-zero exit code if errors are detected.


 Attempt to run a TFLint deep check:

Copy code
tflint --deep --aws-region=us-west-2





Run TFLint in normal mode:

Copy code
tflint



Run the normal scan that ignores the notice rule, but add the debug option to list the rules that are in TFLint:

Copy code
tflint --error-with-issues --ignore-rule=aws_instance_not_specified_iam_profile --debug
